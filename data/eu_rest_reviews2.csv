France;The Frog at Bercy Village;Negative;Rude manager;May 2024 •;The manager became agressive when I said the carbonara was not good. She was rude. It was  a very bad experience. The worst in Rome in many years.
France;The Frog at Bercy Village;Negative;A big disappointment;Feb 2024 •;I ordered a beef fillet ask to be done medium, I got it well done cooked and very dry, when I told them they took the steak and after 20 minutes they brought me another steak that was completely rare, I left all the steak , and they asked me about it but charged me the fool price.
France;The Frog at Bercy Village;Negative;Pretty Place with Bland Food;Nov 2023 •;This is an attractive venue with welcoming, albeit but somewhat slow service. The offerings are pleasingly presented but most everything has no taste. It was as though ingredients were just assembled without seasoning: a lovely restaurant, except for the food.
France;The Frog at Bercy Village;Negative;Great service and wine but inedible food;Mar 2023 •;"Sadly I  used the high TripAdvisor rating too literally. We have been fortunate to eat at a number of fine restaurants so  know that amazing buzz from  a mouthful of fine freshly cooked food from a great chef.
Never before have we eaten a tasting menu and never will we again.
Ad Hoc has a great ambience with attentive friendly service and all the paired wines were exceptional.
Maybe we hit a night when the chef was off but every single course of food was certainly not freshly cooked and , as we passed the kitchen on the way to the bathroom, noticed plates of  precooked food ready to go on the tasting menu plates. If it had been the odd dish that disappointed, we would have accepted that it might have just been our palates not liking it. As it was every plate of food was not hot, bland, lacking any spark and had probably been sitting around for a while.l
All the serving staff were great as was the wine but I failed to finish any plate offered. 
The tasting menu looked good value but a simple bowl of hot freshly cooked pasta would have done better justice to the wine.
When asked ,I admitted , with that great English understatement, that I had been disappointed. I found 17 euros had been deducted from the 190 euro bill so it was nice that they noticed.
Probably best to avoid the tasting menus and enjoy their great wine selection with some pasta and maybe cheese course.

I feel responsible that I made a poor choice not realizing that this is a place geared for tourists.
An expensive mistake."
France;The Frog at Bercy Village;Negative;Avoid- Worst meal in Rome - possibly ever;Nov 2022 •;From the start this meal was bad- especially given the price. We visited for my husbands birthday after being recommended by our local hotel. The lady in charge appeared at our table as we arrived to basically up-sell the truffle menu. Plonked some truffles on the table and then with no explanation of how they would enhance the dishes gave us a rehearsed speech which she proceeded to repeat word for word at every single table. If the food had been good we could have forgiven this but it wasn’t. The best parts were the bland bits as at least they were inoffensive - nothing was seasoned and sauces were completely tasteless with strange and weird combinations. But the worst part of the meal was my husbands inedible medallions of ‘lamb’ dish. This was made up of a tiny amount of lamb gristle and fat wrapped around some mushy stuff we couldn’t identify. Fillet of beef was sort of well cooked (frankly hard to get wrong) but served with exactly the same sauce as the lamb, some reconstituted mash in strange tube shapes and tasteless, watery spinach. We asked for wine recommendations. The wines were ok but we weren’t told what they were, they weren’t explained to us (I had to ask what mine was and was told it was ‘local’) and we weren’t offered any to try. With so much choice nearby and so many better (and much cheaper options) I’d avoid.
France;The Frog at Bercy Village;Negative;Shocking management, TERRIBLE service by mum and daughter!! FOR Tourist ONLY!!;Jul 2021 •;"We visited this restaurant on Saturday night and we had the most disappointing service and food experience ever. It was my partner's bday celebration weekend.

The restaurant is run by a blonde Manager and her daughter wich had the most terrible attitude, they both made sure we will never be back there.
We were sitting at the table near the window but the ac was off and outside about 35 degrees. Halfway through our meal (truffle tasting menu with wine pairing), we asked to move anywhere else because it was too warm there.
The young waitress (the daughter) asked the manager (her mum) to move us, but she replies a very sharp NO!!!!! Also, a dog pooped just in front of us, on the pedestrian side, but apparently, according to the same waitress, that was nothing that concerned the restaurant. Anyhow now not only was it crazy hot but with a nice poo view too.
So we could not move anywhere even though the restaurant was empty, for no reason. Asked to talk to her mum (The Manager) she never touches the table or acknowledges us. How can you deny to a couple with 230 euro bills to move to another table when your restaurant is empty?
Finally, a gem of a waitress with curly hair approached the table and moved us to another spot, where we spent the rest of the evening in confinement because as I said one side of the restaurant was empty for the whole night.
I have been managing restaurants for my whole life, and I never gave such an awful service and attitude to my guests.

The tempo of service completely wrong, food was getting to our table way earlier than wine.
The wine was poured into the glasses and set in the station for about 20 minutes before being served, subjected to the bacterias and dust since everyone was passing by.

Food was good but if you are used to first-class and fine dining service keep out from this place!"
